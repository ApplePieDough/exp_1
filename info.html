        A very big draw of football is the simplicity of the game. to get satrted, one needs only a ball and a pair of shoes. It's played in a flat grass field and it has two rectangular goal posts at the opposite short ends of the rectangular field. 
    </p>
    <h4>Players and Rules</h4>
    <p>
        The first and the most important rule of football is that the players can't use their hands. One exception to this is the Goal keeper. the goal keeper is the player responsible for guarding the goal post and is allowed to block incoming vollies using their hands.

    <p>
        Other than the goal keeper, rest of the 10 players have designated roles but they are mostly arbitrary and what position one playes does not give them special excemptions or equipment.
    </p>
    <h4>Spacing</h4>
    <p>
        Obviously, the ball is not to be kicked or thrown outside the marked field. when that does happen, the team responsible is penalized as the opposing team is allowed to throw the ball in from the border by hand.
    </p>
    <h4>Penalties</h4>
    <p>
        Penalty kicks are one the most thrilling elements of Football. They can be granted to a team for an opposing team's offence or they can be used as tie breakers. A penalty kick is shot from 11 meters from the goal post and only the player taking the kick and the goalkeeper are allowed to stay inside the designated penalty area

    <h2>Formats of a Football Match</h2>
    <p>
        Though the official football match has 11 players on each team and a large field, the popularity of football has given way to various other formats of play that encourage different playstyles. 
    </p>
    <h4>Freestyle Football</h4>
    <p>
        With incredible passion for the game and the need to express oneself, football players develped freestyle football. As the name might suggest, it lacks a rigid definition. 
        <br>
        It's played on the football equivalent of a YMCA basketball court. The primary objective is decided by the player. it can be to earn respect among their community by besting their peers or it can be to entertain spectators.
        <br>
        Freestyling often includes self-imposed rules apart from the standard "no-hands".

        in the video above, the player has restricted himself to only using his legs to manipulate the ball. Other restrictions can be the exclusive use of chest and shoulders or just the head.

    <h2>How to get good</h2>
    <p>The above video is supposed to act as a tutorial but just in the short 50 seconds, you can guage the amount of controll the player needs to have on the ball before they even start learning the flashy tricks. So instead of being discouraged, you should start with playing now. <br><br> Immediately.
    <br>
    <br>
    the best way to get better at football is to play. There is no way the actual experience can be taught through text. <br><br> But as for some advice -> 
        <ul>
            <li>Choose the right shoe for you. Instead of letting a brand or an influencer tell you what to wear, try out shoes yourself. And remember, <b>they dont have to be expensive.</b> or cleats for that matter. Freestyle football is played in flat sole shoes.</li>
            <li>Run and condition train to increase stamina. being able to around the field quickly and frequently is a massive asset in a football match. If you have better stamina and pacing than the opponents, you will immediately have a massive advantage.</li>
            <li>Don't restrict yourself to a position. Try palying defense and offence to properly judge where you stand. If you are versetile enough, you can also be a mid-fielder and don't shy away from trying goalkeeping as well.</li>
