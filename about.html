    <h2>Why football?</h2>
    <p>
        As a kid, you are always on the hunt for a good game that doesn't require much equipment or preperation to play. With a deflated ball, an open field, hilly or otherwise, and a bunch of my friends, we could have so much fun we'd lose track of time. <br><br>
        And as I grew older, the love for the game carried with me through highschool where I played several national level tournaments. <br><br>
        Besides just fun, the culture around football and how it was used by colonized populations, playing in unique, unorthodox styles that angered their captors and at the same time expressed their individuality and defiance is an inspiration to me. 
    </p><br>
    <h3>sources and inspirations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=search">google search </a> result page gave me the idea to put the navigation bar below the actual header of the webpage. it makes it so the user feels like they are still on the page as they are focused on their pointer when they click the link and even after the page has been loaded they still see the same options.</li>
