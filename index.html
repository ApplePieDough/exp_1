    <h4>How it started</h4>
    <p>
        The Most Beautiful Game, as it’s been described by what is the biggest audience that any sport has yet garnered, or just football(or soccor). Like any other popular and widespread thing, it’s hard to track where it really started and who started it but, furthest,  it can be traced back to <a href="https://backyardsidekick.com/how-soccer-started-the-history-of-soccer/">206 B.C China</a> in it’s most basic form. It was meant to train soldiers. Then and it evolved as it’s own game and the invention of modern football was done in England in the 19th century
    <br><br>
        Today it is watched by <a href="https://www.pledgesports.org/2017/03/top-10-most-watched-sports/">3.5 billion fans</a> with the world cup being a globally celebrated event. Football achieved this popularity through it’s simplicity, fanfare, colonialism (yes) and countless other minor, omnipresent reasons

    <h4>How Football is played</h4>
    <p>
        Modern Football is played between two teams of 11 players through two halves lasting 45 minutes each. The purpose of both the teams is to get the ball behind the goal post line behind the opposing team, the only catch being, the players are not allowed to use their hands. any other body part is fair game but the moment a player touches their hand to the ball, the game is paused.

    <p>
        There are two international standards for football leagues. Private leagues like the one hosted by the <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/">"Union of European Football Associations"</a> are considered by many to be the highest order of skill in standard football but the fifa world cup is agreed upon by the majority as being the ultimate competition in 11 versus 11 football.
